## 📘 About

AccidentGuard applies computer vision and deep learning concepts to analyze video streams and identify accident occurrences. Traditional monitoring relies on manual surveillance, which leads to slow response times. This project addresses this by automating accident detection, allowing faster emergency response and smarter traffic management.
